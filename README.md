# Random-Forest Classification

I have applied random forest algorithm to the **Boston dataset** to predict **medv**. In other words, **medv is the label**, and the other **13 variables** in the dataset are the attributes.

Then I Split the dataset randomly into **two equal parts**, which will serve as the training set and the test set. 

Generated **B = 100 bootstrapped** training sets (BTS) from the training set

Used each BTS to train for a decision tree of **height h = 3**. At each node of random forest I do not considering all attributes, but only a sample of them.

Calcualted the **training MSE and test MSE**
